Logical operators return a logical data type such as TRUE or FALSE. 

3 tipos primários 

AND (sometimes represented as & or && in R)
OR (sometimes represented as | or || in R)
NOT (!)

if statement
The if statement sets a condition, and if the condition evaluates to TRUE, the R code associated with the if statement is executed.

In R, you place the code for the condition inside the parentheses of the if statement. The code that has to be executed if the condition is TRUE follows in curly braces (expr). Note that, in this case, the second curly brace is placed on its own line of code and identifies the end of the code that you want to execute. 

if (condition) {

 expr

}


#### Pacotes
Tidyverse: the tidyverse is a collection of R packages specifically designed for working with data. It’s a standard library for most data analysts, but you can also download the packages individually. 

Quick list of useful R packages: this is RStudio Support’s list of useful packages with installation instructions and functionality descriptions.

#### Trabalhando com Pipes
%>% faz o output de um como input do otro
(and then)

função filter
função arrange
função groupby
nested function - exemplo: arrange(filter(DataFrame, coluna == x), coluna )
ou pipe
%>% DataFrame
filter(coluna =x ) %>% arrange(coluna)


#### S3 

Dataframe é uma coleção de colunas, parecida com uma tabela

head()
str() < estrutura
colnames()
mutate() < cria uma nova colunas
data.frame()

as_tibble(diamonds) organiza e deixa apenas os 10 primeiros registros, facilitando a visualização.

readr functions
The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data. readr supports several read_ functions. Each
function refers to a specific file format.




read_csv(): comma separated (CSV) files
read_tsv(): tab separated files
read_delim(): general delimited files
read_fwf(): fixed width files
read_table(): tabular files where columns are separated by white-space
read_log(): web log files

Wide to long with tidyr
The pivot_longer and pivot_wider functions
There are compelling reasons to use both formats. But as an analyst, it is important to know how to tidy data when you need to. In R, you may have a data frame in a wide format that has several variables and conditions for each variable. It might feel a bit messy. 

That’s where pivot_longer()comes in. As part of the tidyr package, you can use this R function to lengthen the data in a data frame by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns. Similarly, if you want to convert your data to have more columns and fewer rows, you would use the pivot_wider()function.
