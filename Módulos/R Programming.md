#### Operadores
<- 
\- 
\+
/
\*

Logical operators return a logical data type such as TRUE or FALSE. 

3 tipos primários 

AND (sometimes represented as & or && in R)
OR (sometimes represented as | or || in R)
NOT (!)

if statement
The if statement sets a condition, and if the condition evaluates to TRUE, the R code associated with the if statement is executed.

In R, you place the code for the condition inside the parentheses of the if statement. The code that has to be executed if the condition is TRUE follows in curly braces (expr). Note that, in this case, the second curly brace is placed on its own line of code and identifies the end of the code that you want to execute. 

if (condition) {

 expr

}


#### Pacotes
Tidyverse: the tidyverse is a collection of R packages specifically designed for working with data. It’s a standard library for most data analysts, but you can also download the packages individually. 

Quick list of useful R packages: this is RStudio Support’s list of useful packages with installation instructions and functionality descriptions.

<b> Tidyverse </b>

#### Trabalhando com Pipes
%>% faz o output de um como input do otro
(and then)

função filter
função arrange
função groupby
nested function - exemplo: arrange(filter(DataFrame, coluna == x), coluna )
ou pipe
%>% DataFrame
filter(coluna =x ) %>% arrange(coluna)


#### S3 

Dataframe é uma coleção de colunas, parecida com uma tabela

head()
str() < estrutura
colnames()
mutate() < cria uma nova colunas
data.frame()

as_tibble(diamonds) organiza e deixa apenas os 10 primeiros registros, facilitando a visualização.

##### importando


readr functions
The goal of readr is to provide a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data. readr supports several read_ functions. Each
function refers to a specific file format.




read_csv(): comma separated (CSV) files
read_tsv(): tab separated files
read_delim(): general delimited files
read_fwf(): fixed width files
read_table(): tabular files where columns are separated by white-space
read_log(): web log files

### Limpando os dados
O básico

Pacotes Here, Janitor, Skimr e tidyverse

Funções para analise
skim_whtout_charts()
select()
head()
glimpse()

#### Trocar nome das colunas
rename()
rename_with(data, tolower ,



separete()
unite()

Wide to long with tidyr
The pivot_longer and pivot_wider functions
There are compelling reasons to use both formats. But as an analyst, it is important to know how to tidy data when you need to. In R, you may have a data frame in a wide format that has several variables and conditions for each variable. It might feel a bit messy. 

That’s where pivot_longer()comes in. As part of the tidyr package, you can use this R function to lengthen the data in a data frame by increasing the number of rows and decreasing the number of columns. Similarly, if you want to convert your data to have more columns and fewer rows, you would use the pivot_wider()function.




### S4
GGplot2

- Aesthetics
- Geoms
- Facets
- Labels e annotations

Os gráficos são criados através de uma combinação de layers

<b>ggplot</b>( data = dataframe) + 
    <b>geom_point</b>(mapping=aes(x=x,=y)

<b>Sequência gramatical do ggplot</b>
1. Começar com ggplot e especificar os dados que serão usados
2. Adicione o geom_function para mostrar os dados
3. mapeie as variáveis que serão usadas no aes


#### Aestehetics
Através do aesthetics podemos destacar pontos importantes.
- cor
- formato
- tamanho
  
Aesthetics para pontos
- x
- y
- color
- shape
- alpha
- size


Podemos combinar vários geom


geom_jitter


geom_bar
o padrão é contar o número de linhas
fill -> cor dentro

<b> Facets </b>
Divide o gráfico 
facetwrap(~variável)

#### Filtrando os dados
https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/03-vizwhiz-1/#1-4-putting-it-all-together-dplyr-ggplot
Example code
data %>%
    filter(variable1 == "DS") %>%  
    ggplot(aes(x = weight, y = variable2, colour = variable1)) +  
    geom_point(alpha = 0.3,  position = position_jitter()) + stat_smooth(method = "lm")


#### Anotações

- Label
- Annotation
Direciona a atenção a aspectos importantes dos dados.
exemplo: ggplot.... + labs(title="Titulo do gráfico")
- Titles
- Caption
- Subtitles

Para antações dentro do gráfico -> annotate

# R Markdown resources

---

**R Markdown** is a useful tool that allows you to save and execute code, and generate shareable reports for stakeholders. As you learn more about how to use it, it can be helpful to bookmark some resources to refer to later.

This reading explores some great online resources that will help you learn more about R Markdown and how to use it to document your analysis.

## R Markdown documentation

RStudio's [R Markdown documentation](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) includes a series of tutorials that will help you learn about the main features of R Markdown, including code chunks, output formats, notebooks, interactive documents, and more. The tutorials include online lessons that you can complete directly in your RStudio Cloud workspace.

## R Markdown reference materials

RStudio has developed a reference guide and a cheat sheet that you can bookmark and use whenever you practice writing R Markdown files.

- The [R Markdown Reference Guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf?_ga=2.49295910.1034302809.1602760608-739985330.1601281773) contains three sections: Markdown syntax, knitr chunk options, and Pandoc options. The guide is super detailed and includes tons of examples and explanations so that you can easily find the exact information you need to customize your R Markdown documents.
- The [R Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf?_ga=2.49295910.1034302809.1602760608-739985330.1601281773) is a convenient summary of the different steps and workflow processes for R. It also includes sections with abbreviated explanations of knitr and pandoc chunk options, and other useful information to review or look up while you work.

## R for Data Science book

For a well-organized introduction to the basics of R Markdown, check out the [Communicate](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/communicate-intro.html) section of the **R for Data Science** book. It covers the main features and functions of R Markdown, the various output formats, and the workflow for combining text and code to create an analysis notebook.

## R Markdown: The Definitive Guide

If you want to really explore the capabilities of R Markdown in a systematic way, [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to the R Markdown ecosystem. This book contains four main parts:

1. [Part I](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html) explains how to install the relevant packages and offers an overview of R Markdown, including the syntax for Markdown and code chunks.
2. [Part II](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/documents.html) provides detailed documentation of the built-in output formats included in R Markdown, like document formats and presentation formats.
3. [Part III](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/dashboards.html) shares several R Markdown extension packages that allow you to build different applications or generate output documents with different styles.
4. [Part IV](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html) covers advanced topics in R Markdown.

Let’s check out a CV template included in the “vitae” package.

First, open up RStudio and run the install.packages() function to install the package:

**install.packages("vitae")**

Then, load the package:

**library(vitae)**
